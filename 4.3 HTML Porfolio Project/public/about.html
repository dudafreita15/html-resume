<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 30 year old English teacher from Brasilia. I have been a teacher for 11 years and I have decided to take risks towards what 
makes me truly happy, change my career and become a programmer. My pursuit hasn't been easy, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the correct path. </p>

<p>I teach during the day and I study at night to become a programmer. I live together with my boyfriend in Sudoeste, Bras√≠lia, and I love 
going to the gym and being with the people I love. I took a course on computer Science and now I have been taking a bootcamp of Web Development. 
I am very satisfied with all the tasks I have accomplished so far.
</p>

<p>This is the beginning of my journey, and I am confident I will do my best.</p>
